The key to debugging the cd collection app: use valgrind.

To compile, do
  gcc -g -Wall cd_coll_ch6.c -lcurses
To run, do
  valgrind ./a.out 2> stderr.out

(curses uses stdout for all output, so the valgrind data is unaffected).
(Also, you can print any log messages to stderr and they will similarly go
to the file.)
